virtualization can reduce hardware costs, power consumption, and space.

                route virtualization
                security function virtualization


application scenario for vsys
    network isolation for large and smes
    cloud computing and security gateway 


vsys features 
    independent management
    resource allocation(the activities of one firewall do not affect the other firewalls)
    traffic isolation - traffic is different (however, can be set to communicate with each other if needed)
    independent configuration - each vsys can have its own configuration, policies, and rules

types of vsys
    public system 
        special and exists by default 
        inherits the configuration of the physical system
        manages virtual systems and their resources and communication btn them 
    virtual system 
        this is an independent logical firewall 


configuration roadmap 
    enable the virtual system function and create virtual systems
    configure and alocate resource class 
    allocate interfaces (public and virtual system interfaces)
    configure ip addresses
    configure routes 
    configure security policies and rules
    configure nat policies
