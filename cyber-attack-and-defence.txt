ddos attacks are hard to defend against because it is difficult to distinguish legitimate traffic from attack traffic.
firewalls defend against the following : 
    single packet attacks
         scanning attacks 
            these probe the network before the real attacks 
                include ip sweep attack,
                    an attacker can use icmp packets (ping , tracert) to probe a network and know what systems are online
                    #how to defend , if the number of requests from a single ip address exeeds a certain threshold, block the ip address
                 port scan attack 
                    probing a system to determine which ports are online
                    #how to defend , if number of requests from single ip to different ports exeeds threshold , block the ip address
         malformed packet attacks
             attackers send malformed packets in an attempt to crash the target systems 
                 ping of death 
                 smurf 
                    attacker send large number of icmp to many devices with the source set to the target server, causing the devices to reply to the target , network bandwidth and system resources are used 
                 fraggle
                 Land attack 
                 ip spoofing
                    and attacker sends packets with false source ip address
                    #the firewall checks whether the outbound interface corresponds to the source ip address in the routing table 
                 teardrop
                 fragment flag bit and offset bit in the ip header 
                 so the attacker modifies the offset of the bit so that the receiver struggles to reassemble the packet, causing wastage of system resources 
                 #the firewall checks whether the fragment offsets are correct and whether the fragment flags are set correctly
                 ip fragment attack
                 tcp flag attack

         special packet attacks 
             use special control packets to probe the network before the real attack 
                 icm redirect attack 
                 tracert attack 

    ddos attacks
        these attacks block legitimate users from accesing the system
        consuming bandwidth and resources of the target system
